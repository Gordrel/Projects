Preferred Plan Calc
This main.cpp calculates how many points a Santa Clara University student should have every day of every week for a quarter.
It assumes you are using the preferred meal plan, which has more meal points than the basic meal plan. 
It works by assuming you spend the same amount of points each day on average from your starting value. 
When run, the code also explains some of the calculations done.
